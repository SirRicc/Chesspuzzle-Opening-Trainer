# Chesspuzzle-Opening-Trainer
This project will solve my problem of not beeing able to play chesspuzzles on Lichess.org "sorted by opening".


# Requirements:
You´ll need to have Selenium Web Driver installed since we´re fetching server-side rendered html
which is not visible while using a "regular" webcrawler, aswell as for automated redirects.

# ToDo:
create event listener 
automate redirects from libary
