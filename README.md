# Chesspuzzle-Opening-Trainer
This project will solve my problem of not beeing able to play chesspuzzles on Lichess.org "sorted by opening".


# Requirements:
You´ll need to have Selenium Web Driver installed since we´re fetching dynamic server-side rendered html
wich is not visible while using a "regular" webcrawler aswell as for automated redirects.
